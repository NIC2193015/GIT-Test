# Epic Python Script
This project is intentionally as complicated as it gets. It prints a greeting to the console.
Perfect for testing your Python environment or putting your awesome Python skills to the test.

## What it does
- Prints “Hello, world! This is the complicated Python script ever written.”

## Server
The image I attached is a picture of my cobbled together server with zip-tied Noctua fans to the front to cool the epic Seagate Exos drives.
